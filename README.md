Dockerized Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana

## How to use it?

First run: 
```docker-compose up```

Wait for it to get started and now you can access Kibana via
 `http://localhost:8081` or Elasticsearch `http://localhost:8081/elasticsearch`.
 
You can stop the cluster by either running `docker-compose down` or by just using `CTL + C`.
